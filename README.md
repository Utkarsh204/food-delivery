This project is a full-featured Food Delivery Web Application built using the MERN stack â€“ MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It replicates real-world food ordering platforms, allowing users to browse food items, add them to a cart, place orders, and pay securely using Stripe. The app includes a responsive frontend, user authentication, order management, and a full admin dashboard.

The backend handles user management, cart operations, order processing, and integrates with MongoDB Atlas for cloud data storage. The admin panel enables administrators to manage food items, monitor orders, and update order statuses in real time.

This project is ideal for understanding the structure and flow of a real-world e-commerce application, including both user and admin workflows, from frontend UI to backend APIs and database integration
